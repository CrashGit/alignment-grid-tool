# Grid Alignment Tool
Requires AutoHotkey v2

Have you ever tried creating a gui and you're positive you have done the math correctly but for some reason the controls just aren't aligning how you expected? This aims to help aid you in seeing if two controls are at the same x or y position.

By default, double tap `F4` to toggle the grid. Then click anywhere on your primary monitor to get it closer to the elements you're testing. You can use the `arrow keys` to move it 1 pixel in the given direction. And if you want, you can use the `+` and `-` keys to increase the thickness.
