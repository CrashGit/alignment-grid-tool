# Grid Alignment Tool
Requires AutoHotkey v2

Have you ever tried creating a gui and you're positive you have done the math correctly but for some reason the controls just aren't aligning how you expected? This aims to help aid you in seeing if two controls are at the same x or y position so you can manually adjust them.

By default, double tap `F4` to toggle the grid. Then click anywhere on your primary monitor to get it closer to the elements you're testing.

`arrow keys` move it `1` pixel in the given direction.

`ctrl & arrow keys` move it `5` pixels in the given direction.



`+` and `-` keys increase the thickness by `1` pixel.

`ctrl & +` and `ctrl & -` keys increase the thickness by `5` pixels.

Alternatively, `ctrl + scrolling` will change the thickness as well.

Changing the thickness is useful for determining the distance between controls.
